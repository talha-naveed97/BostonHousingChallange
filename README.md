# BostonHousingChallange

Task description


Objective

The objective is to build a robust, portable and accurate model.

Robust - we will be looking at how thoroughly you explore, clean and exploit the data

Portable - you can use any libraries you want but it should be easy for us to recreate the same environment for us to test it

Accurate - maximising accuracy is the ultimate goal but you have to pick the metric you think best represents this objective


Format

Create a notebook in the same folder as the data. In this notebook you will explore and process the data and then use it to build a model. We should be able to run the notebook to replicate your results (approx. is fine).

The data is based on the scikit-learn Boston dataset but has been augmented with additional data. It can be found in the 4 files:
 - boston.csv
 - area_stats.csv
 - history.csv
 - target.csv
The description of the data can be found in the data_description.txt file.


Ultimately, what we want to see is how you work. Document your work well (comments to explain what you are doing), format your code for readability and if you run out of time and do not get to do something you wanted to, write down what you planned to do and how you think it would have affected your results.


Good luck!
